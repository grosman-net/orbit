# Orbit üöÄ

**Modern Server & Cluster Management for DevOps and Developers**

Orbit is a lightweight, intuitive, and extensible control center that makes it effortless to install, configure, and monitor software on Linux servers. Bring Heroku-like simplicity to your own infrastructure without the complexity of Kubernetes or the legacy constraints of traditional control panels.

## ‚ú® Why Choose Orbit?

Managing servers shouldn't require deep terminal expertise. Orbit provides:

- **1-Click Software Management** ‚Äì Install or remove packages without touching the terminal
- **Visual Service Control** ‚Äì Start, stop, restart, or monitor system services through a clean web interface
- **Smart Config Builder** ‚Äì Generate correct configuration files with intuitive UI controls
- **Comprehensive Monitoring** ‚Äì Real-time visibility into CPU, RAM, Disk, and Network metrics
- **Secure Architecture** ‚Äì Lightweight agent-based design with minimal footprint
- **Extensible Platform** ‚Äì Modern API-first design for customization and integration

## üèóÔ∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go (REST/gRPC API)
- **Agent**: Go or Rust (lightweight daemon)
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL / SQLite
- **Deployment**: Single-binary or containerized deployment

## üìã Project Roadmap

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Core Platform (MVP) [In Progress]
- Agent installation script (single command bootstrap)
- Package manager integration (apt, yum, pacman)
- Basic package actions (list, install, remove, upgrade)
- Service management (systemd: start/stop/restart/status)
- Web UI: authentication & secure sessions
- Server overview dashboard (CPU, RAM, Disk, Uptime)

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Usability & Developer Experience
- Config Builder UI ‚Äì checkbox & dropdown based configuration
- Auto-generate configs for Nginx, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.
- User roles & permissions (admin, dev, read-only)
- Basic alerting system (CPU/RAM/Disk thresholds)
- REST + gRPC API for automation

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Multi-Server & Clusters
- Multi-node management (add/remove servers in one dashboard)
- Cluster view (map of all nodes + health status)
- Bulk actions (install/remove/update across servers)
- SSH key & secrets manager
- Simple backup/restore for configs

### Phase 4 ‚Äì Advanced Monitoring & Extensions
- Real-time metrics (charts for CPU, RAM, Network, Disk I/O)
- Log viewer with filtering & search
- Plugin system for adding custom modules/packages
- Integration with cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean)
- API tokens for CI/CD pipelines

### Phase 5 ‚Äì Mobile & Enterprise Features
- Mobile app (push notifications, quick actions like restart service)
- Webhooks & integrations (Slack, Discord, PagerDuty)
- Advanced RBAC (team management, org-level permissions)
- Audit logs & compliance features
- High-availability setup for Orbit itself
